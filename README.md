# demo-SpaceFillingCurve
load a geospatial grid of points and return a similar object with Hilbert distance

## This demo uses the following libraries:

- sf
- dggridR
- tidyverse
- reticulate

## It requires python 3 and the modules:

- numpy
- pandas
- daskgeopandas

The modules are installed during first run of the space filling curve script but a prior installation of python 3 might be needed.


## Easy method is to install miniconda automatically




## Otherwise manually install python

'reticulate' has an easy way to install python through miniconda:
https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/articles/python_packages.html
